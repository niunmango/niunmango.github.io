This post serves as a test for my newly constructed website.

The site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in conjunction [What a Theme](https://github.com/thedevslot/WhatATheme) template. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories and if you don't know what GitHub Pages are you can visit on click [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages){:target="blank"} or [here](https://pages.github.com/){:target="blank"}.

This website is a testament to the power and flexibility of these tools, and Iâ€™m excited to share more content with you through this platform. Stay tuned for more updates!
