I live in [Viedma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viedma,_R%C3%ADo_Negro){:target="blank"} on the north of the Argentine [Patagonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia). I was born here but I moved to Buenos Aires, capitol city of Argentina during 1992. I then moved to Madrid, Spain, during 2002. I also lived in Cordoba, Spain, for a short period of time. I then moved back to my hometown in 2014.
